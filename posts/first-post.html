                    <p>
                        This is it. My own corner of the internet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've been building things for a while now, scattered across repositories and forgotten folders.
                        This site is my attempt to bring them together in one place, and more importantly, to start
                        writing about the process.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What you'll find here</h2>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Projects:</strong> Everything I've built that I think is worth sharing.
                        Code, experiments, tools. Some finished, some perpetually in progress.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Writing:</strong> Thoughts on building things, lessons learned,
                        and whatever else I find interesting enough to put into words.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why now</h2>

                    <p>
                        I've always believed that the best way to learn is to build, and the best way
                        to solidify learning is to explain it. This blog is the explaining part.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Plus, there's something satisfying about having your own domain.
                        <code>spiffler.xyz</code> is mine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        More soon.
                    </p>
